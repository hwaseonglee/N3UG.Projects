# N3UG.Projects
This repository is for a discussion about Open Source projects that will be created and maintained by N3UG members. If you have an idea for an Open Source project that you think will be useful for the general community at large, or N3UG members specifically, or to work with technologies and frameworks as an excercise in learning new skills, please feel free to start the discussion by adding an  **issue**.

At each user group meeting we will review the **issues**, discuss and, if agreed to, will assign tasks, or make tasks available for members to sign up for.
